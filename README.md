### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a responsive QR code card component using HTML and CSS. I improved my understanding of:

- Flexbox: for centering elements both horizontally and vertically within the card.
- Mobile-first design: by starting with a layout for smaller screens and scaling it up for larger displays.
- Responsiveness: ensuring the card looks good on various screen sizes using media queries.
- Typography and spacing: adjusting font sizes, line height, and padding to make the content easy to read and visually balanced.
- Box model: applying padding, margin, and box shadows effectively to create a clean and modern design.
- This project helped me strengthen my layout and CSS skills while focusing on best practices for responsive web design.
